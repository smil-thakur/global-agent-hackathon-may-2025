## 🧠 Smart Implementation

<p align="center">
  <img src="./src/assets/clippy-alpha3-multi-agent.gif" alt="Main Agent Workflow" width="600">
</p>

Clippy is designed with a highly intelligent architecture to provide seamless and efficient user interactions:

- **Team Agent Routing**: Clippy uses the Team Agent as a router to intelligently redirect user prompts to either the General Purpose Agent (GAP) or the Terminal Agent (TER) based on the context of the request.
- **Terminal Agent (TER)**:
  - Adapts to the local environment by loading shell profiles, ensuring compatibility with the user's system.
  - Executes subprocesses and smartly appends `yes` or `-y` to commands for zero user intervention, making operations like installations completely hands-free.
- **General Purpose Agent (GAP)**: Equipped with web search capabilities, it can fetch information from the internet to provide accurate and context-aware responses.
- **Shared Memory**: All agents share a common memory, enabling smooth back-and-forth communication. This is particularly useful for complex terminal operations, such as creating a React app, where the General Purpose Agent can suggest a name, and the Terminal Agent can execute the command seamlessly.
- **Cross-Platform System Directory Access**: Clippy includes a cross-platform method to retrieve system directories like Documents, Desktop, Downloads, etc., allowing users to act on these directories with ease, such as organizing files or performing batch operations.

Clippy's architecture ensures a cohesive and intelligent experience, making it a powerful tool for both casual and advanced users.

## 🖼️ New: Multimodal File Summarization (Ctrl+Enter Magic!)

🚀 **Clippy just got a major upgrade!**

Now, with a simple <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> on any file in your search results, you can instantly generate a smart summary—no matter the file type. Whether it's a PDF, image, audio, video, or even a non-standard/binary file, Clippy's new multimodal agent will analyze and summarize it for you in seconds.

- **Universal Summarization:** Summarize PDFs, images, audio, video, and even raw data from non-standard files. If Clippy can't natively parse the file, it will attempt to extract and summarize the raw text content for you.
- **Popup Power:** The summary appears in a beautiful, scrollable popup—no clutter, just clarity. Instantly open the file from the popup if you want to dive deeper.
- **Lightning Fast:** Just select a file and hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>—Clippy does the rest. No menus, no drag-and-drop, just pure productivity.
- **User-Friendly:** If you try to summarize a directory or an unreadable file, Clippy will let you know with a friendly message—no crashes, no confusion.

🎉 **This is a game-changing feature that every user (and hackathon judge!) will love.**

Give it a try and experience the future of file intelligence—right from your keyboard!

## 🖥️ Why Native Wrapper?

The native wrapper is a crucial part of Clippy's architecture, providing the following benefits:

- **Global Key Implementation**: Enables the use of global hotkeys, allowing Clippy to be triggered instantly from anywhere on your system.
- **Overlay Permissions**: Grants the ability to overlay Clippy on top of any app or screen, ensuring seamless accessibility without disrupting your workflow.

These features make Clippy a truly integrated and efficient tool for your desktop environment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

> ⚠️ **Note**: The steps below will not completely set up the project as it is currently under heavy development. The setup process and dependencies are evolving rapidly, and maintaining up-to-date setup documentation is challenging. By the final release, I plan to consolidate all setup steps into a single bash script for ease of use.

1. **Clone this Repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smil-thakur/Clippy.git
   cd Clippy
   ```

2. **Install Requirements**

   We recommend using a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv clippyENV
   source clippyENV/bin/activate  # or clippyENV\Scripts\activate on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup .env**

   Create a `.env` file and add your Gemini API Key:

   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the App**

   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
